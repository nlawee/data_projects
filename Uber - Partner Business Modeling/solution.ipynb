    "> Option 1: _$50 for each driver that is online at least 8 hours, accepts 90% of requests, completes 10 trips, and has a rating of 4.7 or better during the time frame._\\\n",
    "> Option 2: _$4/trip for all drivers who complete 12 trips, and have a 4.7 or better rating._\n",
    "\n",

    "- How much would the total bonus payout be with Option 2?\n",
    "- How many drivers would qualify for a bonus under Option 1 but not under Option 2?\n",
    "- What percentages of drivers online completed less than 10 trips, had an acceptance rate of less than 90%, and had a rating of 4.7 or higher?\n",

    "A taxi driver currently generates $200 per day in fares (before expenses), works six days a week, takes three weeks off, and has the following expenses:\n",

    "> Gas - $200 per week\\\n",
    "> Insurance - $400 per month\\\n",
    "> Vehicle rent (by the week) - $500\\\n",

    "\n",
    "Now, let's assume that the same driver would buy a Town Car and partner with Uber. If he does, his gas expenses would go up by 5%, his insurance expense would decrease by 20%, and he would no longer be renting a vehicle. However, he would need to buy a car. The driver would still take three weeks off per year.\n",
